# Starter web Typescript / Next.js

This starter is based on my personal preferences and has been made to provide a template for any web application built with React, Next.js and Typescript. I am using Yarn and Node v12.1.0 with this starter. It comes with:

- Prettier (and my own prettier configuration in `.prettierrc.json`)
- ESLint (and my own eslint configuration in `.eslintrc.json`)
- Typescript (and my own typescript configuration in `tsconfig.json`)

This starter also includes `pre-commit` as a dependency in order to run ESLint before every commit to make sure the code that will be pushed follows the rules defined in the configuration.
